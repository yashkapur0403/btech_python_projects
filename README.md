We have created a ToDo application named : TaskMate - The ultimate task organizer : 
Herein th user can manage their own daily task;
The task manager can provide you with the following facilities : 
    A user has access to the following : 
     1) Add a new task;
     2) Delete or remove a task;
     3) Update a task;
     4) Mark as completed;
     5) View your files;


Further we are working on : 
  1) Due Date and Reminders:- Which allow users to set deadlines and receive reminders for upcoming tasks.
  2) Notification sound - The system makes a remainder sound of which the task is named whose due time for the day will excede; basically its a remainder alarm to the user to complete its task if completed or to complete the task, come back to the application and mark as done.
